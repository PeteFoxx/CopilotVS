# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! Please follow these guidelines to make reviews fast and reliable.

Getting started

- Fork the repository and create a topic branch from `master`.
- Use descriptive branch names, e.g. `feature/add-login` or `fix/issue-123`.

Development

- Install dependencies: `npm install`.
- Run the dev server: `npm run dev`.
- Run tests: `npm test`.
- Run linter: `npm run lint`.

Commits and PRs

- Use present-tense, imperative commit messages: `Add X to Y`.
- Open a PR with a clear description, testing steps, and references to related issues.
- PR checklist: tests pass, lint passes, updated docs if needed.

Code style

- Follow existing TypeScript style. ESLint and Prettier are configured; format before committing.

Security
